In 1984, they have to ‘keep their lips sealed’ i.e. keep their romance a secret, as love is considered a crime in the novel’s world.

The only thing we can do is to run, and think that someone or something will save us. As this song and the whole album are influenced by 1984, we all know (spoiler alert!) that although they run and ask to be saved, they won’t be protected from harm. \n",

Orwell described your only free space as “the few cubic inches inside your skull”, which is the only place what one would consider ‘the truth’ could be hidden. In this case, and throughout the album, Bellamy compares life in today’s capitalist world as very similar to Orwell’s dystopian Oceania, Eastasia or of course, Eurasia. It’s important to notice that Bellamy isn’t an outright anti-capitalist (he defined himself as a left-leaning libertarian), although The Resistance as an album undoubtedly has themes against the wealthy and the privileged. In addition, in a clever wordplay Bellamy mentions here three of the orwellian ministries: Love, Peace and Truth. \n",

      " Source text: George Orwell’s 1984 contains a secret police known as the ‘Thought Police’ whose job was to prevent ‘thinkcrime’, more commonly ‘thoughtcrime’, which was simply any thought or action the totalitarian English Socialism, more commonly ‘Ingsoc’, Party did not approve of, such of love or political interest. Orwell described your only free space as “the few cubic inches inside your skull”, which is the only place what one would consider ‘the truth’ could be hidden. In this case, and throughout the album, Bellamy compares life in today’s capitalist world as very similar to Orwell’s dystopian Oceania, Eastasia or of course, Eurasia. It’s important to notice that Bellamy isn’t an outright anti-capitalist (he defined himself as a left-leaning libertarian), although The Resistance as an album undoubtedly has themes against the wealthy and the privileged. In addition, in a clever wordplay Bellamy mentions here three of the orwellian ministries: Love, Peace and Truth. \n",
