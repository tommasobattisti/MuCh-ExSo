Orwell described your only free space as “the few cubic inches inside your skull”, which is the only place what one would consider ‘the truth’ could be hidden. In this case, and throughout the album, Bellamy compares life in today’s capitalist world as very similar to Orwell’s dystopian Oceania, Eastasia or of course, Eurasia. It’s important to notice that Bellamy isn’t an outright anti-capitalist (he defined himself as a left-leaning libertarian), although The Resistance as an album undoubtedly has themes against the wealthy and the privileged. In addition, in a clever wordplay Bellamy mentions here three of the orwellian ministries: Love, Peace and Truth."^^xsd:string,

Lips being sealed can be interpreted in two ways: one, they should be always ‘that’ close and two, they should never utter a word to anybody about each other. In 1984, they have to ‘keep their lips sealed’ i.e. keep their romance a secret, as love is considered a crime in the novel’s world. If the government found out about them, they would be punished, as specified in the verses."^^xsd:string,

                "In 1984, Winston and Julia have a secret rendezvous in a rented room of an antique shop, where there are no “telescreens” for surveillance such that their secret love affair may be hidden from the authorities. They live in fear that the Party may find out about their love and have them punished."^^xsd:string,
                "In Orwell’s 1984, Winston and Julia cannot show any public signs of their relationship lest it be discovered by the Party; even a stray smile from Julia in public could lead to discovery and torture at the hands of the Party."^^xsd:string,
                "It should have been okay for us to fall in love, but it’s too dangerous in the oppressive world we live in. In 1984, passion and love are considered forms of censored thought that would have been punished. They should have the freedom to love each other, but they do not."^^xsd:string,

The only thing we can do is to run, and think that someone or something will save us. As this song and the whole album are influenced by 1984, we all know (spoiler alert!) that although they run and ask to be saved, they won’t be protected from harm."^^xsd:string,

They cannot have a romantic relationship in the world of “1984”, where love is a crime, like we who live in a normal world and expect love to last forever.

Lips being sealed can be interpreted in two ways: one, they should be always ‘that’ close and two, they should never utter a word to anybody about each other. In 1984, they have to ‘keep their lips sealed’ i.e. keep their romance a secret, as love is considered a crime in the novel’s world. If the government found out about them, they would be punished, as specified in the verses."^^xsd:string .

    ns3:text "Metaphorically, it’s at night when we are safe, when we can do secret things. When the night ends, everybody can see us, so “we can’t pretend”. The only thing we can do is to run, and think that someone or something will save us. As this song and the whole album are influenced by 1984, we all know (spoiler alert!) that although they run and ask to be saved, they won’t be protected from harm."^^xsd:string .

    ns3:text "Winston and Julia are surely going to be arrested by the Ministry of Love for their secret love. They are bound to be broken apart. They cannot have a romantic relationship in the world of “1984”, where love is a crime, like we who live in a normal world and expect love to last forever. Any evidence of Winston and Julia meeting in secret and having a love affair must be concealed or erased."^^xsd:string .

ns2:annotation_4 a ns2:Annotation ;
    ns3:text "George Orwell’s 1984 contains a secret police known as the ‘Thought Police’ whose job was to prevent ‘thinkcrime’, more commonly ‘thoughtcrime’, which was simply any thought or action the totalitarian English Socialism, more commonly ‘Ingsoc’, Party did not approve of, such of love or political interest. Orwell described your only free space as “the few cubic inches inside your skull”, which is the only place what one would consider ‘the truth’ could be hidden. In this case, and throughout the album, Bellamy compares life in today’s capitalist world as very similar to Orwell’s dystopian Oceania, Eastasia or of course, Eurasia. It’s important to notice that Bellamy isn’t an outright anti-capitalist (he defined himself as a left-leaning libertarian), although The Resistance as an album undoubtedly has themes against the wealthy and the privileged. In addition, in a clever wordplay Bellamy mentions here three of the orwellian ministries: Love, Peace and Truth."^^xsd:string .
