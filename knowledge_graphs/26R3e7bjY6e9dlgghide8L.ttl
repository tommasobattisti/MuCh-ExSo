As if our minds are deranged

Beneath the sheltering sky
We have this strange obsession

Tea in the Sahara with you

The young man agreed
He would satisfy their need
So they danced for his pleasure
With a joy you could not measure
They wait for him here
The same place every year
Beneath the sheltering sky
Across the desert he would fly

Tea in the Sahara with you
Tea in the Sahara with you

Tea in the Sahara with you

They would climb a high dune
They would pray to the moon

As their eyes searched the land
With their cups still full of sand
